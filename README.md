JS Remove Background Effect

Description:
This is a simple image comparison project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It creates an interactive remove background effect where the user can move their mouse across an image to reveal the original version underneath. The project is written completely from scratch with no external libraries or frameworks.

Features:
- Overlay two images (background vs original).
- Interactive vertical slider line with arrows.
- Mouse-tracking effect that adjusts the reveal width in real time.
- Responsive design that adapts to the container size.
- Lightweight and easy to customize.

Use Cases:
- Show before and after photo edits.
- Compare background-removed images with their originals.
- Create a demo effect for image processing or retouching.
- Highlight transformations in a clean and interactive way.

Technologies Used:
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling and layout
- JavaScript for interactivity

How It Works:
The project listens for mouse movement inside the image container. The horizontal mouse position relative to the box is used to dynamically set the width of the overlaying image and the position of the divider line. This creates a smooth reveal effect as the user moves the mouse left and right.

Installation and Usage:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project folder.
3. Run index.html in your browser.
4. Move your mouse across the image to interact with the effect.
